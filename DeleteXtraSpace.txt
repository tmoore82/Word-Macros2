' DeleteXtraSpace Macro
'
'This macro, true to its name, deletes extra spaces.
'PDF-to-Word conversions often show up with any number
'of spaces between words, depending on the white space
'in the original. Or, if you have a doc that uses
'two spaces after a period, and you only want one,
'this cleans up the extras.
'
'If you need a document to have two spaces after a period,
'run this in combination with TwoAfterP.
