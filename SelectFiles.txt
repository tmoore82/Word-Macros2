'Sometimes it's necessary (or simpler) to let a user choose a file,
'whether to open it, to edit it, or to use it as a reference point.
'This macro by itself just stores the file path as a string,
'but combined with other macros, it can share that reference
'and use it to manipulate selected files.

    'Declare a variable as a FileDialog object
    'and create a FileDialog object as a File Picker dialog box
    Dim diaSelectFile As FileDialog
    Set diaSelectFile = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFilePicker)

    diaSelectFile.Show
    
    strPickedFile = diaSelectFile.SelectedItems(1)

    'Set object variable to Nothing
    Set diaSelectFile = Nothing
End Sub
